This is a running list of businesses in SF open during 2020's shelter in place. Neighbors can use this list to find businesses near them, information about the businesses (stored in MongoDB), and, eventually, make suggesstions and changes to the map in real time.
 
 To work on -- please contact me for the API keys; or, create your own API keys for free using [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

 The JSON file in here (`src/data/restos.json`) isn't being used in the current implementation, but feel free to use it yourself as "dummy data"! 

 Run **npm install** to install all Node Dependencies, then, run **npm start** to get this up and running on your localhost.

 More documentation to come!
